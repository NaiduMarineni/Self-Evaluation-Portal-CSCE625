# Self-Evaluation-Portal-CSCE625
The motivation behind the CSCE 625 Self Evaluation project is to help students in assessing their
preparation for the graduate-level Artificial Intelligence course. This project can assist students in
understanding the course prerequisites. By using this evaluation portal, the students can make an
informed decision as to whether they are sufficiently prepared to register for the class.

The requirements for the project were provided by Dr Duncan Walker, Professor, Texas A&M
University. The key stakeholders of this project are prospective students, teaching assistants, and
the course instructors.

Initial code is taken as it is from this repo - https://github.com/wagerpascal/team_froyo 

**Summary of Iterations**

Iteration 0 : Met the customer to understand expectations and for formulating the requirements.
The team worked on creating UI mockups and on drafting user stories.

Iteration 1 : The stories for migrating/updating the Database schema were taken up first to support
related application changes in the future iterations.

Iteration 2 : Major requirements including creating Multiple-Choice Questions, automating the
grading and report generation, support for Mathematical equations, and setting up a password
recovery system were taking up during this iteration. Furthermore, the views were also modified to
reflect the schema changes performed in Iteration 1.

Iteration 3 : The focus during the third iteration was to fix the previously failing acceptance tests. In
addition, the logic to support “Short Answer” questions was created.

Iteration 4 : The team worked on enhancing the User Interface to make it responsive. Also, the
evaluation for the “Short Answer” question was made robust by introducing partial checking.
RSpec tests were added to increase code coverage.
